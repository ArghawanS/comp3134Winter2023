The vulnerability arises because the "storexss.php" file reads and outputs the contents 
of "storedxss.txt" directly to the browser without any form of sanitization.
This means that any malicious code contained in the "storedxss.txt" file will
be executed on the user's browser when they visit the "storexss.php" page.

A potential attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into 
submitting a form or inputting data into the web application that is then stored 
in the "storedxss.txt" file. The attacker could then insert malicious code into the 
file that is executed when the user visits the "storexss.php" page, allowing them to 
steal user data or perform other malicious actions.
